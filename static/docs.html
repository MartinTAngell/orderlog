        <h2 id="hosting-and-database">Hosting and Database</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For the demo of this project, we used DigitalOcean cloud hosting and their managed database services.
            </li>
            <li>You do not have to use DigitalOcean, but for whatever database you use, you must use MongoDB as the
                program is only built for that.</li>
            <li>In DigitalOcean, we used a droplet for hosting and all of the following things were done from the
                provided DigitalOcean console.</li>
            <li>For other hosting services, we would recommend speaking with a specialist from those services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="downloading-prerequisite-software">Downloading prerequisite software</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/MartinTAngell/orderlog.git">this</a> link and download the projects
                code.</li>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">this</a> link to
                download NPM and NodeJS for your specific operating system.</li>
            <li>Use a terminal to enter the folder with the projects code inside it.<ul>
                    <li>Inside this folder, type this</li>
                </ul>
                <pre><code class="language-console">npm i
</code></pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will install the packages used by the project</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="setting-up-authentication">Setting up authentication</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We want to be able to control which users can create and edit work orders.</li>
            <li>We are going to do that with Auth0, which will allow users to link their Google accounts and save me
                hours of work developing a custom authentication system that would do the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>First, set up an <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> account.</li>
            <li>Then create a new application under the Regular Web App category using Node.js (Express) as a technology
                and choose to implement instead of downloading a sample.</li>
            <li>Change &quot;<a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>&quot; to whatever your websites
                url is.</li>
            <li>Don&#39;t close this webpage yet and don&#39;t add the code, it&#39;s already there.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="setting-up-env">Setting up .env</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We need to set up environment variables so that our app doesn&#39;t just connect to the demo&#39;s data.
            </li>
            <li>Start by going into the project folder and creating a file just called &quot;.env&quot;</li>
            <li>The following is the format of the file</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-env"># DB Settings
CONNECTION_STRING=&quot;connection string&quot;

# Auth0 Information
SECRET_KEY=&quot;generated secret key&quot;
BASE_URL=&quot;base url&quot;
CLIENT_ID=&quot;client id
ISSUER_BASE_URL=&quot;issuer url&quot;
</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>You see all the values inside of the quotes, we are goingg to change all of that.</li>
            <li>The connection string should be provided by your database management service, which we will talk about
                shortly. Make sure that you are using a mongodb database </li>
            <li>A secret key can be generated by typing the following command into a terminal</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-console">openssl rand -hex 32
</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>Put the key it generates into where it says secret key</li>
            <li>Base URL, CLIENT_ID, and ISSUER_BASE_URL all have values that you can find in the web page that you had
                open earlier. They should be located in what appears like a list of values wrapped in a pair of curly
                braces.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="final-setup">Final Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Finally, to turn the website on, type this command in the console.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code class="language-console">node app.js
</code></pre>
        <ul>
            <li>As long as you have the console open this will work, but to keep it open always look into <a
                    href="https://pm2.keymetrics.io/">pm2</a>.</li>
        </ul>
