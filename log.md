## Setup
### GitHub Repository
TLDR: I created a new git repository to hold my code and set up the files. [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart) is the quickstart guide, but I'll add the exact commands that need to be typed in.
- Create an empty folder for the project
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository.
- Get the specific link for the project from GitHub
- If necessary, log in
- Open up a terminal or command line
```console
git init
git remote add origin (put the link gotten from GitHub here)
git branch -M main
```
- When a lot of code has been completed and it's time to save all the code, run these commands to save and log the code in GitHub
```console
git commit -m "(Put a message here that describes the work you did)"
git push -u origin main
```
- Then check in GitHub that it updated

### Technologies Used (This will probably update over time)
- ChatGPT (obviously)
- Node JS (To run a JavaScript Web Application)
- Express JS (To create and access the very simple API to get the information)
- MongoDB (To hold our database)
- DigitalOcean (Web hosting)
## Setting Up for NodeJS and ExpressJS
### Installing
- First thing that has to happen is installing NodeJS. [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) is a link to download and install Node.
- Next, create a file called "app.js". Don't put anything in it yet, we'll get there.
- Run the following command. It will ask for subsequent information which should be very easy to provide. I recommend using the MIT license when it asks for one.
```console
npm init
```
- Next we install JavaScript modules
```console
npm i express
npm i mongoose
```
### Basic app.js
- Putting this basic code into our app.js file will now create a very simple website that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. We'll link the Express JS app to the ChatGPT code in a moment.
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.route('/').get((req, res) => {
	res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, (error) => {
	if (error) {
		return console.log(`Server failed to start: ${error}.`);
	}
	console.log(`Server now accessible at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
- Now we need to run our web app. We can do this by typing the following into the terminal.
```console
node app.js
```
## Creating our web app
### Getting our HTML page to appear
- Add the .html file generated by ChatGPT into your project. I put it inside another folder called routes under the name index.html. (For the pure reason of convention)
- Once this is done, we are going to change our app.js file to include a few more.
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const path = require('path');

app.route('/').get((req, res) => {
	/* Where it says "/routes/index.html", make sure it points to where
       you put the html file generated by ChatGPT*/
	res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + '/routes/index.html'));
});

app.listen(port, (error) => {
	if (error) {
		return console.log(`Server failed to start: ${error}.`);
	}
	console.log(`Server now accessible at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
- The only changes are the addition of the line that says 
```const path = require('express');``` and changing the line that said ```res.send('Hello, World!');``` to what it is now.
